The architecture of the application is based on 6 components that work together in order to achieve the desired output.

1. Initializing - declaring the variables and files for use in the program.

2. Reading game - gets 1 game from the input and continues until the game's ending is found.

3. Setting up - sets all variables to 0 for use with the game instance.

4. Building the game - takes the game instance and reads piece by piece to figure out what symbol is in each slot.

5. Checking rules - reads the game and checks the rules to see what outcome the game has.

6. Verifying - goes over the outcomes and prints in the output the state of the game that has been read.
